  # Manifest files

    # If you are providing a web application manifest file (see
    # the specification: https://w3c.github.io/manifest/), it is
    # recommended that you serve it with the `application/manifest+json`
    # media type.
    #
    # Because the web application manifest file doesn't have its
    # own unique file extension, you can set its media type either
    # by matching:
    #
    # 1) the exact location of the file (this can be done using a
    #    directive such as `<Location>`, but it will NOT work in
    #    the `.htaccess` file, so you will have to do it in the main
    #    server configuration file or inside of a `<VirtualHost>`
    #    container)
    #
    #    e.g.:
    #
    #       <Location "/.well-known/manifest.json">
    #           AddType application/manifest+json               json
    #       </Location>
    #
    # 2) the filename (this can be problematic as you will need to
    #    ensure that you don't have any other file with the same name
    #    as the one you gave to your web application manifest file)
    #
    #    e.g.:
    #
    #       <Files "manifest.json">
    #           AddType application/manifest+json               json
    #       </Files>
